Created and optimized the flight schedule for flights flying to and from 3 airports with different ground times and different flight times by imposing time constraints and constraints on the number of gates at each destination using python. Used Pandas to create and format the data frames. Created a CSV file with all possible departure and arrival locations at all possible times without a clash between 6:00 AM and 10:00 PM everyday and named it "flight_schedule.csv".
